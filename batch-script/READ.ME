To use the batch scripts, copy them to the projects top directory and then
run them. They will NOT work if they are in the `batch-script` directory.


`\batch-script\build.bat`	makes directory `build`
                        	assembles `hello.asm` into `build\hello.asm.o`
                        	then links the .o file into `build\hello.exe`

`\batch-script\clean.bat`	removes the `build` directory, if it exists
